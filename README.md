# Interactive Programming #

This is the code for our interactive programming project. We have created a puzzle game called "grid" using pygame. 
The files are organized under the folders: views, controllers, and models. 
The file "main.py" runs it all in the end.

### Setup ###

Follow these steps to setup the game:

1. git clone git@github.com:pdemetci/Interactive_Programming.git
2. cd Interactive_Programming
3. export PUZZLE_PATH=`pwd`
4. python main.py
